# MongoLib

## Why use it?

Already the MongoDB database solution is easy to use regardless of the language used, thanks to its no-sql and non-relational feature.

The library here allows you to add a layer of simplicity over the official driver. Like the creation of structures, represented by classes, their instance represents a document.

## Prerequisites

In order for the library to operate as expected:

[installation.md](installation.md)

## Start preparing everything

Before you can fully use the library, some classes need to be instantiated

[initialize-a-connection.md](first-steps/initialiser-une-connexion.md)

[create-structure.md](first-steps/creer-une-structure.md)

[creer-a-manager.md](first-steps/creer-un-manager.md)
